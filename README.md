# Starcat - Chat together
Starcat has a specific goal, to make communication easy again. Starcat is an open source, self hostable, chat protocol, offering an easy api that lets developers create applications.

Starcat is powered by PHP and accepts http requests. Only your username and password is required to create an account!

Starcat was made to let people chat on a server, hosting starcat on one server, will let that user create their account, and even talk with others. If you like self hosting for yourself only, you can even disable account create and just have a single account, there is no *official* starcat server.

# Installation
Starcat was made to be flexible in a way that lets you just drop in the files and then you are done, all setup is done server side.

Head over to the [Wiki's](https://github.com/saderror256/starcat/wiki), the installation guide is right here PUT LINK HERE

# Can I talk to others on different servers?
Yep! Starcat's api is able to communicate with other servers, so one cannot just chat with others on the same server, this would become a disaster!

# Is starcat going to have an official server?
Probably, but we made Starcat a tool that lets everyone self-host it, but thats not its entire purpose, the other idea is that you can create your own starcat hosting service, and offer free accounts that others can use, depending on if your server is beefy enough to host it.
